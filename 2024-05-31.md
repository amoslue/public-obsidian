When to use Influx DB and Prometheus? #systemDesign
- **Choose InfluxDB if**:
    
    - You need a general-purpose time-series database.
    - You have high write loads and need efficient querying for time-series data.
    - You need to manage retention policies and downsampling of historical data.
    - You require a SQL-like query language for interacting with time-series data.
- **Choose Prometheus if**:
    
    - Your primary goal is monitoring and alerting.
    - You prefer a pull-based model for collecting metrics.
    - You need a flexible and powerful query language for time-series data (PromQL).
    - You want built-in support for alerting and integrating with alert management systems.
    - You are looking for a standalone, self-contained monitoring solution.
