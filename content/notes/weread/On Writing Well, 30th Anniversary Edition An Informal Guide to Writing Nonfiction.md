### 1. The Transaction

> 📌  avocation. ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-5-1510-1520
- 💭 业余爱好 - ⏱ 2023-09-02 07:30:04 

> 📌 Let it all hang out 
> ⏱ 2023-09-02 07:31:56 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-5-2330-2349

> 📌 But all of them are vulnerable and all of them are tense. They are driven by a compulsion to put some part of themselves on paper, and yet they don’t just write what comes naturally. They sit down to commit an act of literature, and the self who emerges on paper is far stiffer than the person who sat down to write. The problem is to find the real man or woman behind the tension. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 03:21:08 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-5-5497-5878

> 📌 gimmicks 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 03:22:43 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-5-6761-6769

### 2. Simplicity

> 📌 The answer is to clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can’t exist without the other. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 03:57:20 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-6-4371-4488

> 📌 verbiage

> 📌 shoddily 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 04:01:23 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-6-5858-5866

> 📌 rune 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 04:02:21 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-6-6582-6586

### 3. Clutter

> 📌 euphemism 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 04:22:32 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-7-4310-4319

> 📌 Clutter is political correctness gone amok. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 04:24:10 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-7-4625-4668

> 📌 political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.... Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 04:34:01 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-7-5643-5825

### 4. Style

> 📌 There is no style store; style is organic to the person doing the writing, as much a part of him as his hair, or, if he is bald, his lack of it. Trying to add style is like adding a toupee. At first glance the formerly bald man looks young and even handsome. But at second glance—and with a toupee there’s always a second glance—he doesn’t look quite right. The problem is not that he doesn’t look well groomed; he does, and we can only admire the wigmaker’s skill. The point is that he doesn’t look like himself. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 05:20:18 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-8-3887-4400

> 📌 Readers want the person who is talking to them to sound genuine. Therefore a fundamental rule is: be yourself. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 05:30:05 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-8-4616-4726

> 📌 Telling a writer to relax is like telling a man to relax while being examined for a hernia, and as for confidence, see how stiffly he sits, glaring at the screen that awaits his words. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 05:32:31 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-8-4966-5150

> 📌 they are a self-conscious attempt at a fancy prologue. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 05:34:18 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-8-7230-7284

> 📌 two people, conducted on paper, and it will go well to the extent that it retains its humanity. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 05:34:58 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-8-7589-7684

> 📌 cop-out. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 05:55:41 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-8-9969-9977

> 📌 Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your own opinions. Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going. 
> ⏱ 2023-09-03 06:02:06 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-8-13541-13748

> ⏱ 2023-11-23 11:26:59 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-9-6295-6302

> 📌 Never say anything in writing that you wouldn’t comfortably say in conversation. 
> ⏱ 2023-11-23 11:27:40 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-9-6422-6503

### 6. Words

> 📌 You’ll never make your mark as a writer unless you develop a respect for words and a curiosity about their shades of meaning that is almost obsessive. 
> ⏱ 2023-11-27 17:24:11 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-10-1660-1812

> 📌 The race in writing is not to the swift but to the original. 
> ⏱ 2023-11-29 16:22:58 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-10-6320-6380

> 📌 ou’ll find ruffians and riffraff, miscreants and malefactors, reprobates and rapscallions, hooligans and hoodlums, scamps and scapegraces, scoundrels and scalawags, jezebels and jades. 
> ⏱ 2023-11-29 16:29:06 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-10-8826-9010

> 📌 Also bear in mind, when you’re choosing words and stringing them together,how they sound. This may seem absurd: readers read with their eyes. But in fact they hear what they are reading far more than you realize. Therefore such matters as rhythm and alliteration are vital to every sentence. 
> ⏱ 2023-11-29 16:34:44 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-10-10270-10562

### 7. Usage

> 📌 sleazy 
> ⏱ 2023-12-04 02:49:13 ^CB-G3zDSxDTr93K6io6gp8Ng8pf-11-3596-3602
