## Highlights
- Explanation:
  To solve this problem, you can use the concept of interval scheduling, a common problem in **computer science**. The aim is to find the minimum number of machines required to complete all tasks without conflict. This requires a machine to run one task at a time, without overlap.
  The algorithm to this problem is to sort the tasks by their end times and assign tasks to a machine if the machine is free at the task's start time. Each time a new machine is needed, increment a counter. The counter represents the minimum number of machines required.
  Here is a potential java **implementation**: 
  public int minMachines(int[][] tasks) { 
  Arrays.sort(tasks, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]); 
  PriorityQueue queue = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]); 
  for(int[] task : tasks) { 
  if(queue.isEmpty() || task[0] <= queue.peek()[1]) 
  queue.offer(task); 
  else { 
  queue.poll(); 
  queue.offer(task); 
  } 
  } 
  return queue.size();
