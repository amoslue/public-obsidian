- Category: #articles
- Summary: Tensions over Taiwan continue to escalate, with China intensifying its diplomatic battle to gain recognition and support for its claim that Taiwan is a part of China. China aims to be the sole representative of China and wants countries to adopt its view on Taiwan. Despite China's efforts, most Western countries lean towards supporting Taiwan, with the US even loosening restrictions on interactions and increasing military aid. China has focused its efforts on gaining support from developing countries, particularly those in Africa, the Arab world, and the Pacific. The struggle over Taiwan is not just a diplomatic battle, as China has increased military activity near the island, changing the status quo and raising concerns about the potential for forceful action.
