- Category: #articles
- Summary: Joe Biden's first term as president has seen a surge in government spending, a focus on boosting workers through unions, and an industrial policy aimed at reshaping the American economy. If he were to be re-elected for a second term, Biden's agenda would include a desire to boost workers further, increased social spending, tougher competition policies, more investment in green technology, and higher taxes on large firms and the wealthy. However, the implementation of these policies would depend on the composition of Congress and the level of Republican support. Additionally, Biden's trade agenda would likely be limited, with a focus on domestic policies and potential adjustments to tariffs on China.
