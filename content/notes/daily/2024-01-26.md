what is generic?
- "generic" refers to a feature that allows classes, interfaces, methods, or functions to be written with placeholders for types. These placeholders can then be specified and replaced with actual types when the generic is used. Generics are primarily used to create data structures or algorithms that can operate on multiple types of data, improving code reusability, type safety, and readability.
