1. **Class and Object**: The core of OOP is the division of tasks into objects (which are instances of classes) and classes (which define objects). A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects.
    
2. **Encapsulation**: This is about bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an objectâ€™s components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data.
    
3. **Inheritance**: This is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. The new class, known as a subclass, inherits attributes and methods of the existing class, known as a superclass. This allows for reusing existing code and improving software modularity.
    
4. **Polymorphism**: It refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class is used to refer to a child class object. Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.
    
5. **Abstraction**: This concept involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object. In other words, it deals with the outside view of an object (interface).

what is generic?
- "generic" refers to a feature that allows classes, interfaces, methods, or functions to be written with placeholders for types. These placeholders can then be specified and replaced with actual types when the generic is used. Generics are primarily used to create data structures or algorithms that can operate on multiple types of data, improving code reusability, type safety, and readability.

When to use Influx DB and Prometheus? #systemDesign
- **Choose InfluxDB if**:
    
    - You need a general-purpose time-series database.
    - You have high write loads and need efficient querying for time-series data.
    - You need to manage retention policies and downsampling of historical data.
    - You require a SQL-like query language for interacting with time-series data.
- **Choose Prometheus if**:
    
    - Your primary goal is monitoring and alerting.
    - You prefer a pull-based model for collecting metrics.
    - You need a flexible and powerful query language for time-series data (PromQL).
    - You want built-in support for alerting and integrating with alert management systems.
    - You are looking for a standalone, self-contained monitoring solution.
