    - ⏱ 2023-01-22 18:52:45 

- 📌 The past gathered out of the darkness where it stayed, and the dead raised themselves to live before him; and the past and the dead flowed into the present among the alive, so that he had for an intense instant a vision of denseness into which he was compacted and from which he could not escape, and had no wish to escape.

- 📌 "But you're bright enough--and just bright enough--to realize what would happen to you in the world. You're cut out for failure, and you know it.Though you're capable of being a son-of-a-bitch, you're not quite ruthless enough to be so consistently. Though you're not precisely the most honest man I've ever known, neither are you heroically dishonest. On the one hand,you're capable of work, but you're just lazy enough so that you can't work as hard as the world would want you to. On the other hand, you're not quite so lazy that you can impress upon the world a sense of your importance. And you're not lucky--not really. No aura rises from you, and you wear a puzzled expression. In the world you would always be on the fringe of success, and you would be destroyed by your failure. So you are chosen, elected;providence, whose sense of humor has always amused me, has snatched you from the jaws of the world and placed you safely here, among your brothers." 
    - ⏱ 2023-01-27 21:02:50 

- 📌 You, too, are cut out for failure; not that you'd fight the world. You'd let it chew you up and spit you out, and you'd lie there wondering what was wrong. Because you'd always expect the world to be something it wasn't, something it had no wish to be. The weevil in the cotton, the worm in the beanstalk, the borer in the corn. You couldn't face them, and you couldn't fight them; because you're too weak, and you're too strong. And you have no place to go in the world

- 📌 cool formality 
    - ⏱ 2023-02-02 19:00:36 

- 📌 Mrs.Bostwick's face was heavy and lethargic, without any strength or delicacy,and it bore the deep marks of what must have been a habitual dissatisfaction.

- 📌 He did not sleep; he lay on the bed and looked out the single window until the dawn came, until there were no shadows upon the land, until it stretched gray and barren and infinite before him. 
    - ⏱ 2023-02-27 19:01:50 

- 📌 Their lives had been expended in cheerless labor, their wills broken, their intelligences numbed 
    - ⏱ 2023-02-27 19:06:36 

- 📌 Those things that he held most deeply were most profoundly betrayed when he spoke of them to his classes; what was most alive withered in his words; and what moved him most became cold in its utterance.

## XI


- 📌 concede his defeat 
    - ⏱ 2023-03-21 09:53:24 

- 📌 He felt at times that he was a kind of vegetable, and he longed for something--even pain--to pierce him, to bring him alive. 
    - ⏱ 2023-03-21 10:01:20 
## XII


- 📌 nuisance 
    - ⏱ 2023-03-21 13:59:03 

- 📌 the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another. 
    - ⏱ 2023-03-21 14:01:24 
## XIII


- 📌 In his extreme youth Stoner had thought of love as an absolute state of being to which, if one were lucky, one might find access; in his maturity he had decided it was the heaven of a false religion, toward which one ought to gaze with an amused disbelief, a gently familiar contempt, and an embarrassed nostalgia. Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart. 
    - ⏱ 2023-03-21 14:04:27 

- 📌 And it occurred to him at last, with the finality of knowledge, that he had never known another human being with any intimacy or trust or with the human warmth of commitment.

    - ⏱ 2023-03-24 01:26:12 
## XVI


- 📌 he saw hatred and suspicion become a kind of madness that swept across the land like a swift plague; he saw young men go again to war, marching eagerly to a senseless doom, as if in the echo of a nightmare 
    - ⏱ 2023-03-27 13:41:28 
## XVII


- 📌 He had dreamed of a kind of integrity, of a kind of purity that was entire; he had found compromise and the assaulting diversion of triviality. He had conceived wisdom, and at the end of the long years he had found ignorance.
