“A common use of standard deviations is to periodically inspect the data set for a metric and alert if it has significantly varied from the mean. For instance, we may set an alert for when the number of unauthorized login attempts per day is three standard deviations greater than the mean. Provided that this data set has Gaussian distribution, we would expect that only 0.3% of the data points would trigger the alert.
Even this simple type of statistical analysis is valuable because no one had to define a static threshold value, something which is infeasible if we are tracking thousands or hundreds of thousands of production metrics.†”


“In other words, when the distribution of the data set does not have the Gaussian shape described earlier, the properties associated with standard deviations do not apply. For example, consider the scenario in which we are monitoring the number of file downloads per minute from our website. We want to detect periods when we have unusually high numbers of downloads, such as when our download rate is greater than three standard deviations from our average, so that we can proactively add more capacity.
Figure 15.2 shows our number of simultaneous downloads per minute over time, with a bar overlaid on top. When the bar is dark, the number of downloads within a given period (sometimes called a “sliding window”) is at least three standard deviations from the average. Otherwise, it is light.”
