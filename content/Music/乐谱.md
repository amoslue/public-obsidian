Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low  
I leaned back on my radio  
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll  
"Lotta soul, " he said  
Then the loud sound did seem to fade  
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase  
That wasn't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He'd like to come and meet us  
But he thinks he'd blow our minds  
There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He's told us not to blow it  
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile  
He told me  
Let the children lose it  
Let the children use it  
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone, so I picked on you  
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too  
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two  
Look out your window, I can see his light  
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight  
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright

There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He'd like to come and meet us  
But he thinks he'd blow our minds  
There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He's told us not to blow it  
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile  
He told me  
Let the children lose it  
Let the children use it  
Let all the children boogie

Starman waiting in the sky  
He'd like to come and meet us  
But he thinks he'd blow our minds  
There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He's told us not to blow it  
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile  
He told me  
Let the children lose it  
Let the children use it  
Let all the children boogie
