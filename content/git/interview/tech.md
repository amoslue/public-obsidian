1. **Class and Object**: The core of OOP is the division of tasks into objects (which are instances of classes) and classes (which define objects). A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects.
    
2. **Encapsulation**: This is about bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an objectâ€™s components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data.
    
3. **Inheritance**: This is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. The new class, known as a subclass, inherits attributes and methods of the existing class, known as a superclass. This allows for reusing existing code and improving software modularity.
    
4. **Polymorphism**: It refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class is used to refer to a child class object. Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.
    
5. **Abstraction**: This concept involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object. In other words, it deals with the outside view of an object (interface).
